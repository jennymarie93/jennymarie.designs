                                <p>I was born in Texas, raised in New York & aged in Hawaii. I am a cat-mom of two and on a seemingly endless journey to figure out how to live my best neurodivergent life in this neurotypical world. I am the type of person that sprains my ankle getting up from a bench, is always covered in glitter, paint, cat hair or flour and will randomly forget how stairs work. Basically, I am a bit of an odd ball but I have found that the secret to success (for me, at least) is to...</p>

                                <p>My creative process is visceral&mdash;I could give you a written or verbal breakdown of my work&mdash;but I would prefer to take you on a convoluted journey rather than tell you a linear story. This may leave you with more questions than answers and that is intentional. I want this to be a glimpse into my brain and creative process - and surprise! It is messy, colorful and a little bit bizarre, just like me.</p>

                    <h1>Pro-Abortion Lettering</h1>
                    <h2>Lettering Background</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to work on a project that I am passionate about and learn a new skill, so I decided to combine the two into a semester-long project. Starting in January 2023, I began my lettering journey by purchasing a collection of books shown below. I started by practicing some calligraphy with my new set of speedball pens and then dove into my pile of books.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Books</h2>
                    <p>My collection also included The Ultimate Guide to Modern Calligraphy & Hand Lettering for Beginners by June & Lucy, The Art of Hand Lettering for Beginners: Beautiful Projects and Essential Techniques by Joanna Muñoz, and the Speedball Textbook by S. Cunningham, C. Rohrs & S. Shah.</p>
                    <p>While all of the books were wonderful, I found that the House Industries Lettering Manual by K. Barber, In Progress by Jessica Hische & The Golden Secrets of Lettering by Martina Flor to be the most helpful.</p>
                    <h2>The Project</h2>
                    <p>[Hypothetically] Planned Parenthood is in need of some new material for use on their social media and merchandise. They aim to raise awareness about their pro-abortion campaign as well as funding to help make abortion more accessible to those who are in need.</p>
                    <h2>The Process</h2>
                    <p>I easily spent 100+ hours drawing and another 100+ hours in Adobe Illustrator. I have a fat folder of sketches and 32 versions of .aic files to show for it. Please be patient&mdashI plan on uploading some of my process photos soon! In&nbsp;the&nbsp;meantime...</p>
